# Bayesian Approach to Designing Microstructures and Processing Pathways for Tailored Material Properties

[Paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=zZPICTs5gB)

## Description

This repository contains research code associated with work entitled *"Bayesian Approach to Designing Microstructures and Processing Pathways for Tailored Material Properties"*. The proposed framework utilizes a conditional continuous normalizing flow (CNF) trained with the flow matching objective proposed by [Lipman *et al.* (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02747), and a composite process-structure and structure-property linkage as the forward model for implicitly learning the joint distribution between processing parameters and an arbitrary property set.

## Examples
The framework is briefly displayed below. A prior distribution over the constutient motility and initial concentrations in the phase-field model is defined, alongside a likelihood constructed by a composition of probabilistic forward models (process-structure and structure-property linkages). The microstructure is represented in a statistical sense with a low-dimensional PC representation of its 2-point spatial correlations ($\alpha$). A CNF is trained with conditioning provided by the composite forward model - providing a continuous source of training data exceeding the initial dataset. Lastly, inference is performed through simulation of the underlying ODE, providing posteriors over processing parameter space $p(\theta | k^{*})$. A visualization of this posterior is projected into microstructure space through an additional forward simulation of the phase-field model, providing $p(m | k^{*})$.

Model performance is evaluated across the entire dataset. Each property set is considered as a target for the framework, where points are sampled from the posterior $p(\theta | k^{*})$ and passed once more through the forward models. A parity plot is shown, alongside its estimated density, and CDF for each property considered.

## Contents
This section provides a brief description of the contents of this repository.

1. *Data*: Contains processing parameters, resulting property set (elastic + thermal properties), and PC scores of 2-point spatial correlations of microstructures in the initial dataset.

2. *Helpers*: Code for helper functions utilized in main script *cnf.py*.

3. *Models*: Contains code for instantiating the sparse variational multi-output
 Gaussian process (SV-MOGP) used in this work, along with the actual trained models utilized.
 
4. *cnf.py*: Main executable for training and post-processing results from the conditional continuous normalizing flow.

5. *main_gpytorchNG_ps.py*: Main executable for training of the SV-MOGP process-structure linkage.
 
6. *main_gpytorchNG_sp.py*: Main executable for training of the SV-MOGP structure-property linkage.

## Execute
Inference of the conditional microstructure distributions provided above can be replicated as
```
python cnf.py
```
where the *train* and *load* flags can be turned on to prevent training and load an existing model as
```
python cnf.py --train --load
```
allowing for postprocessing of the results.
