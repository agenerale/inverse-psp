# Bayesian Approach to Designing Microstructures and Processing Pathways for Tailored Material Properties
This repository contains research code associated with a forthcoming article entitled
*"Bayesian Approach to Designing Microstructures and Processing Pathways for Tailored Material Properties"*. The proposed framework utilizes a conditional continuous normalizing flow trained with the flow matching objective proposed by [Lipman *et al.* (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02747), and a composite process--structure and structure-property linkage as the forward model for implicitly learning the joint distribution between processing parameters and an arbitrary property set.

## Contents
This section provides a brief description of the contents of this repository.

1. *Data*: Contains processing parameters, resulting property set (elastic + thermal properties), and PC scores of 2-point spatial correlations of microstructures in the initial dataset.

2. *Helpers*: Code for helper functions utilized in main script *cnf.py*.

3. *Models*: Contains code for instantiating the sparse variational multi-output
 Gaussian process (SV-MOGP) used in this work, along with the actual trained models utilized.
 
4. *cnf.py*: Main executable for training and post-processing results from the conditional continuous normalizing flow.

5. *main_gpytorchNG_ps.py*: Main executable for training of the SV-MOGP process-structure linkage.
 
6. *main_gpytorchNG_sp.py*: Main executable for training of the SV-MOGP structure-property linkage.

## Execute
Inference of the conditional microstructure distributions provided above can be replicated as
```
python cnf.py
```
where the *train* and *load* flags can be turned on to prevent training and load an existing model as
```
python cnf.py --train --load
```
allowing for postprocessing of the results.
